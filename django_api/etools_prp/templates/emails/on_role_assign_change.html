    <p>Dear {{ user.get_full_name }},</p>
    <p>Your role in UNICEF's Partner Reporting Portal is assigned.</p>
    <p>You now have access to:</p>
    {% if portal == 'CLUSTER' %}
        <p>Cluster: {% if role.role == 'CLUSTER_SYSTEM_ADMIN' %}All clusters{% else %}{{ role.cluster.title }}{% endif %}</p>
    {% elif portal == 'IP' %}
        <p>Country: {{ role.workspace.title }}</p>
        <p>Role: {{ role.get_role_display }}</p>
    {% endif %}
    <p>If you are the Authorized Officer, it is important that you make yourself familiar with the identity management options in the system and how the administration of the portal can be delegated to others in your organization.</p>
