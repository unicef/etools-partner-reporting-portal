# Overview

The goal of Cluster Reporting in PRP is to enable IMO’s and Cluster partners to report on various indicators and have access to the associated data they need to demonstrate progress against targets and to support coordination.

Both IMO’s and Partners have access to Cluster Reporting and can view all data for their respective organizations.

Partners can add

* Custom Project or Import existing projects from OCHA
* Custom Activities and associated custom activity indicators
* Report on Project and Activity Indicators for their organization - both custom indicators and cluster-defined indicators

IMOs can

* Add Custom Project or Import from OCHA on behalf of partners
* Add Cluster Activities
* Add Custom Activities
* Report on all Objective Indicators for their cluster
* Define disaggregations

### Core Data Concepts

Below a visual representation of the core data concepts relating to cluster reporting.  A workspace consists of one or more countries. Each workspace then can have one or more response plans. And each response plan will have one or more clusters associated with it.
