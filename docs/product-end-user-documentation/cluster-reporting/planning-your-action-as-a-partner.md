# Planning your action as a Partner

In this section \("My Planned Action" in the left hand navigation\) of the interface is where the partner can view and setup their planned actions to support the work of the cluster. A checkmark will indicate whether a project is from OCHA. The IMO does not see this section.

{% hint style="info" %}
This section is only visible to a partner user who is logged in.

Partners can add custom Projects here or pull from OCHA.

We will show basic details in a drop down so the partner knows which project they are pulling from OCHA. 

\( **TBD Maciej: After selecting a project from OCHA, we may need to allow partner to select/edit the clusters because the names incoming from OCHA are not standard.**

**TBD Status and Additional information. We might not include Funding Source because there might be multiple. Total funding is not always available so it will be optional. \)**
