# Cluster Indicators

Indicators in a cluster can belong to following entities:

* Cluster Objective
* Cluster Activity
* Partner Project
* Project Activity: Either one of these
  * Custom
  * Associated with Cluster activity

### Add Indicator Modal

IMOs and partners can create their own indicators. They can choose the type of indicator \(quantity, percent, ratio\) and calculation method for reporting periods/locations.

For _**Quantity indicators**_ IMO's set baseline, target and in-need at the indicator level. If this is a Partner indicator, they can set these too. In-need is optional. If baseline is not set, it defaults to 0.

At the location level, IMO can set the admin level and specific location pertaining to the level. In-need is optional to set here. IMOs can add multiple locations and disaggregations too.

For _**Percentage Indicator**_, we have added 2 labels for numerator and denominator. We won’t have In-Need. We’re only going to take one number for each label. The calculation method will be greyed out and defaulted to SUM.

At the location level, IMO can set the admin level and specific location pertaining to the level. In-need is optional to set here. IMOs can add multiple locations and disaggregations too.

When it’s _**Ratio Indicator**_, we will have 2 labels, and will take 2 \#s \(numerator and denominator\) for baseline and target. The calculation method will be greyed out and defaulted to SUM. We won’t have In-Need.

At the location level, IMO can set the admin level and specific location pertaining to the level. In-need is optional to set here. IMOs can add multiple locations and disaggregations too. For ratio indicators, there is a numerator + denominator for baseline & target.

### Edit Indicator Modal

IMO or Partner can edit an indicator. The location admin level, specific location previously, and disaggregations set are not editable. Locations can be added though.

_**Partners can adopt \(Cluster\) Activity Indicators previously set by the IMO**_. They are able to edit the target and add locations. If the partner adds a location, they will be able to include the administration level, specific location for the level and target.

If the Partner would like to propose a new Baseline and in-need to the IMO, they can send a direct message to the IMO. This will be sent to the IMO's email. We will add  partner users name, email, partner name, indicator, project, plan to the modal and message received by the IMO.

### Showing Current Progress against Target and against In-Need

In the Indicator Reports, users will be able to see the current progress against Target and In-Need.

For Quantity Indicators, IMOs will be able to enter new baseline and In-Need for specific locations in bulk. In-need is optional and Baseline defaults to 0.

For Percent Indicators, IMOs will be able to enter a new Baseline. It defaults to 0.

For Ratio Indicators, IMOs will be able to enter a new Baseline. The data key specifies the numerator and denominator.

### Helper Text

When looking at an indicator edit/create modal, the user can click on the 'i' for helper text associated with the field.  

Additionally for calculation method selection we will show a modal similar to in [IP reporting](https://unicef.gitbook.io/prp/product-end-user-documentation/ip-reporting/setting-calculation-methods-for-indicators#demo-indicator-table) where the user will be able to see the impact of that selection.
